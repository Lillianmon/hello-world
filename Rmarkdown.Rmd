## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Below is some extra practice

To make an R code chunk, you can type the three backticks, followed by the curly brackets surrounding a lower case R, put your code on a new line and end the chunk with three more backticks. Thankfully, RStudio recognized you’d be doing this a lot and there are short cuts, namely Ctrl+Alt+I (Windows) or Cmd + Option + I (Mac). Additionally, along the top of the source quadrant, there is the “Insert” button, that will also produce an empty code chunk.

```{r}
print("Hello world")
```
